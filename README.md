This website is created as a fullstack portfolio project using HTML5, CSS3, and Python (Django).

Notes:
<ul>
  <li>The "Book Appointment" link lets you set up a basic appointment with the vet at Sandia Animal Hospital. A confirmation code is provided to you, and you can pull up your information using the confirmation should you need to modify or cancel your appointment.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Future update will include the ability to validate the date to ensure that appointments can't be scheduled past 90 days from the present date.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>At this time, the "New Pet Registration" link is inactive. Future updates of this repository will include an updated New Pet Registration link where you can register your pets with Sandia Animal Hospital.</li>
  <li>Desktop and mobile views have been setup, but tablet views will be updated in a future commit.</li>
